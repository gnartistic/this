  ## Description
  
  This is a react app I created to demonstrate my knowledge of functional components, hooks, and state, as well as my ability to create and style an application using CSS and JSX. I used various npm packages for styling such as sass, animate.css, and fortawesome. I implemented Axios.js for the api request, but was unfortunately unsuccessful. I enjoyed this project, I learned quite a bit while building it. The biggest challenges I faced while developing this app were the API request for the login, and the search bar functionality in the todo list. I spent the first day building and styling the login component, then moved on to the input validation and functionality. After spending another day struggling to get a successful response from the server, I pivoted to the todo list and began building and styling that component. I spent most of my time contemplating the logic and researching the functionality of the search bar. I split it up into 3 parts, the parent component, and two child components. Overall, I am very pleased with what I was able to achieve, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to grow just a lil bit more as a developer through this project.
